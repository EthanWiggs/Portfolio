Stories are written in reverse - each paragraph is inspired by an image uploaded by the other user. By using Firebase authentication, users can create accounts and save their stories.</p><img alt="Login Screen"src="Login.jpg"><p>User accounts must be verified via email, before they can log in.</p><img alt="Verification Screen"src="Verify.jpg"><p>A story is created by one user, who invites a second user based on a web link. The option to create a story, and your existing stories, are available on the dashboard.</p><img alt="Dashboard"src="Dashboard.jpg"><p>Inside each story, the user can see whose turn it is to write. They are prompted to upload an image, or write based on an image.</p><img alt="Adding text to story"src="AddingContent.jpg"><p>You can even nudge your partner to remind them to write their next paragraph.</p><img alt="Nudge your partner"src="Nudge.jpg"><p>This project remains one of my favourites — blending storytelling with interaction design and cloud-based features to create a playful, meaningful collaboration tool.<div style="text-align:center"><a class="back-to-portfolio"href="../../index.html">← Back to Portfolio</a></div></main>
